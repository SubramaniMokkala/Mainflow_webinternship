# ðŸš€ Task 1: Landing Page Development  

This project is a **simple, responsive, and visually appealing landing page** built using **HTML and CSS**. The page includes a **hero section** with a heading, description, and a "Get Started" CTA button, a **navigation bar with dropdown menus**, a **features section** highlighting key offerings, and a **footer** containing copyright information, privacy policy, and terms of service. The styling includes a **modern color scheme, readable fonts, and responsive design** using Flexbox, Grid, and media queries. The dropdown navigation enhances the user experience with smooth hover/click effects.
